# Sentri — Business Plan

**Version:** 2.0
**Date:** December 2024

---

## Executive Summary

Sentri is an AI-powered review response automation platform for automotive dealerships. We monitor reviews across Google, Facebook, DealerRater, and Yelp — then generate and post personalized responses automatically.

**The Problem:** Dealers respond to fewer than 30% of reviews. Poor response rates hurt reputation, SEO, and customer trust.

**The Solution:** AI-native execution. Responses get posted, not just suggested.

**Target:** $10K MRR within 4-6 months (34 dealers at $300/month).

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Phase 1: Validation (Weeks 1-4)

1. Recruit 5 pilot dealers from network
2. Offer 30 days free for feedback
3. Measure: response rate improvement, satisfaction

### Phase 2: First Revenue (Weeks 5-8)

1. Convert pilots to paid
2. Ask each for 2 referrals
3. Build case studies with real data

### Phase 3: Scale (Months 3-6)

1. Direct outreach to dealers with review problems
2. Content marketing (industry data, best practices)
3. Industry presence (associations, events)

### Sales Process

**The Demo That Sells:**
1. Pull up their Google reviews
2. Show unresponded reviews (usually 70%+)
3. Generate live AI response
4. Close: "$299/month for 100% response rate"

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "No time" | "That's why this exists. Zero time after setup." |
| "AI seems fake" | "Let me show you. [Demo live response]" |
| "Tried Podium" | "And you're still not responding. We actually execute." |
| "Too expensive" | "One lost customer costs more than a year of Sentri." |
