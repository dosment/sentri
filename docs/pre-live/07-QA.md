## Testing Philosophy

We have **zero automated tests**. This is a known risk. Before launch, we compensate with:

1. **Exploratory testing** — Human intelligence finding unexpected issues
2. **Risk-based focus** — Test the things that matter most
3. **Heuristic evaluation** — Apply testing oracles to identify problems
