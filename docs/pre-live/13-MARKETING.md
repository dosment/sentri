## 1. Positioning

### 1.1 Core Message

**Problem:** Dealers respond to only 30% of reviews. Every unanswered review is a lost customer.

**Solution:** Sentri generates personalized, on-brand responses automatically. 100% response rate, zero daily effort.

**Proof:** (Need pilot data)

### 1.2 Positioning Statements

| Audience | Statement | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Dealer Principal | "Get 100% response rate without hiring anyone new." | [x] |
| Marketing Manager | "Responses that sound like you wrote them." | [x] |
| General Manager | "Negative reviews never slip through — we queue them for your approval." | [x] |
| CFO/Owner | "For less than the cost of an hour of labor, respond to every review." | [x] |

### 1.3 Competitive Displacement

| Scenario | Pitch | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Has Podium | "You're paying for monitoring but still not responding. Sentri does the work." | [x] |
| Has Birdeye | "Same message — we execute, they just alert." | [x] |
| No solution | "Most dealers respond to 30%. With Sentri, you'll hit 100%." | [ ] |
| Manual responses | "Your team could generate more leads instead of writing responses." | [ ] |
