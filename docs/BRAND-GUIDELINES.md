**Owner:** Marty Neumeier (Brand Strategy)
**Approved by:** Andy Grove (Project Manager)

## Marty Neumeier (Brand Strategist)

> "A brand is not a logo. It's a gut feeling. Let's make sure Sentri creates the right one."

---

## The Onliness Statement

Every strong brand can complete this sentence. Here's ours:

> **Sentri is the ONLY review response platform that executes automatically — not just monitors.**

That's our zag. Everyone else built monitoring tools with templates. We built an execution engine. They watch. We act.

---

## Brand Foundation

### What We Are

**Category:** AI-powered review response automation for automotive dealerships

**Position:** The vigilant guardian of dealer reputation

**Promise:** Every review answered. Zero effort required.

### What We're NOT

- Not a monitoring dashboard (we execute, not just alert)
- Not a template library (we generate, not fill-in-blank)
- Not an enterprise suite (we do one thing, excellently)
- Not another "Dealer-something" vendor

### The Gut Feeling We Create

When a dealer thinks of Sentri, they should feel:

| Feel | Not |
|------|-----|
| Protected | Anxious |
| In control | Overwhelmed |
| Professional | Scrambling |
| Confident | Uncertain |
| Relieved | Burdened |

---

## Brand Name: Sentri

### Why It Works

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Short** | 6 letters, 2 syllables |
| **Memorable** | Sounds like "sentry" — immediate association |
| **Ownable** | Modern spelling, trademarkable |
| **Phonetic** | Easy to say, easy to spell over phone |
| **Verb potential** | "Did you Sentri that review?" |
| **Meaning** | Implies vigilance, protection, standing guard |

### Name Origin

Derived from "sentry" — a soldier stationed to keep guard. The modern spelling (i instead of y) makes it:
- Distinctive and ownable
- Tech-forward without being gimmicky
- Easy to secure as domain/trademark

### Pronunciation

**SEN-tree** (rhymes with "entry")

### Usage

- Always capitalize: **Sentri** (not SENTRI, sentri, or Sentry)
- Never pluralize: "We use Sentri" (not "Sentris")
- Can be used as verb: "Sentri your reviews"

---

## Brand Personality

### Voice Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Vigilant** | Always watching, never sleeping | "Sentri monitors 24/7 so you don't have to." |
| **Confident** | We know what we're doing | "100% response rate. Guaranteed." |
| **Direct** | No fluff, no jargon | "Reviews in. Responses out." |
| **Professional** | Trustworthy, reliable | "Your reputation, protected." |
| **Efficient** | Results with minimal effort | "Set it. Forget it. Done." |

### Voice Don'ts

- Don't be cute or playful (this is serious business)
- Don't use excessive exclamation points!!!
- Don't use "AI" as a selling point (dealers are skeptical)
- Don't sound like every other SaaS company ("we're passionate about...")
- Don't use military jargon excessively (subtle nods only)

### Tone Scale

```
Casual -------|---X------- Formal
Playful ------|-------X--- Serious
Soft ---------|-------X--- Direct
Complex ------|X---------- Simple
```

## Taglines

### Primary Tagline

> **"Your reputation, on guard."**

### Secondary Options (for specific contexts)

| Context | Tagline |
|---------|---------|
| Feature-focused | "Every review answered. Automatically." |
| Problem-focused | "Stop losing customers to unanswered reviews." |
| Benefit-focused | "100% response rate. Zero daily effort." |
| Action-focused | "Reviews in. Responses out." |

### Taglines to Avoid

- "AI-powered review management" (generic, AI skepticism)
- "The future of reputation management" (vague, cliché)
- "We value your reputation" (everyone says this)
- Anything with "revolutionize," "disrupt," or "game-changing"

---

## Visual Identity

### Logo Concept

The Sentri logo should evoke:
- **Shield/protection** — subtle, not literal

- **Modern professionalism** — clean, tech-forward
- **Trust** — stable, reliable

**Logo structure:**
- Wordmark: "Sentri" in clean, modern sans-serif
- Icon: Abstract shield or beacon mark (optional, for small sizes)
- No tagline in logo — keep it clean

### Short Description (30 seconds)

## Brand Guardrails

### Always Do:

1. Lead with the outcome (100% response rate), not the technology (AI)
2. Use "Sentri" consistently — never abbreviate or modify
3. Maintain professional, confident tone
4. Show the product doing the work
5. Be specific about results, not vague about features

### Never Do:

1. Call it "AI-powered" in headlines (use in body copy sparingly)
2. Use competitor names negatively
3. Promise things we can't deliver
4. Use automotive clichés ("drive results," "accelerate growth")
5. Sound like every other SaaS company

### Brand Review Checklist

Before any external communication, verify:

- [ ] Is the Sentri name used correctly?
- [ ] Is the tone confident but not arrogant?
- [ ] Is the message clear in one read?
- [ ] Does it focus on dealer outcomes?
- [ ] Does it feel like Sentri, not generic SaaS?

## Competitive Differentiation

### How We Zag

| Competitors Zig | Sentri Zags |
|-----------------|-------------|
| "Reputation management platform" | "Review response automation" |
| Feature lists (monitoring, alerts, templates) | One outcome: 100% response rate |
| "AI-powered" as headline | AI is invisible — results are visible |
| Dashboard complexity | Simplicity: it just works |
| Enterprise focus | Built for the independent dealer |

### Positioning Statement

**For** automotive dealerships **who** struggle to respond to reviews consistently,
**Sentri** is a review response automation platform **that** achieves 100% response rate automatically.
**Unlike** monitoring tools that still require you to write,
**Sentri** generates and posts personalized responses so you can focus on running your business.

**Marty Neumeier (closing):**

> "Sentri has what most startups don't: a clear 'only.' You're the only review platform that executes automatically. That's the zag. Now protect it. Every touchpoint — dashboard, email, website, sales call — should reinforce that one idea. The moment you try to be everything, you become nothing. Stay vigilant."
